# ebusd plugin for Domoticz

This is a plugin for [Domoticz](https://domoticz.com), for Domoticz to communicate directly with [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd) daemon. Ebus is a protocol to communicate mainly with Vaillant and Saunier-Duval boilers.

## Warning

This is a hobby project, use it if you know what you are doing and at your own risks, I cannot be held responsible for toying and erasing your boiler configuration or breaking your underfloor heating system. I strongly advise to install an hardware protection device for your underfloor heating system, for instance an aquastat on the "burner off" input, that opens at 50째C (protection in case of programming error, or piracy...).

## Prerequisites

Domoticz version must be at least 2024.1.

You need to have [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd) daemon installed, maybe you can install a package directly from [releases](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/releases), and you need to install it with its [configuration files](https://github.com/john30/ebusd-configuration), accessible from network to Domoticz and obviously, a [hardware supported by ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/wiki/6.-Hardware).
The plugin has been tested with ebusd versions 3.0.595c7c0, 3.4 and 23.3 and a Vaillant ecoTEC plus VUI FR 306/5-5 R5 boiler with a calorMATIC VRC470f wireless remote control and VR61/4 underfloor heating system kit.
Check first that ebusd is working properly with the following command directly on the device hosting ebusd:
```
ebusctl find
```

Then check that ebusd telnet connection is available from the device hosting Domoticz (change IP address to ebusd hosting device IP address or name, 8888 is default ebusd port, change it to your telnet port number if different):
```
telnet 192.168.0.10 8888
find
quit
```

You should get the same list as the previous command.

I advise to limit telnet access on you ebusd hosting device to the device hosting Domoticz, for instance, I added the following to my "/etc/rc.local":
```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp ! -s 192.168.0.11 --dport 8888 -j DROP

```

Change IP address to Domoticz hosting device IP address, change port to your telnet port number if different. 

For the plugin to work, ebusd must be started with HTTP JSON --httpport option, for instance on port 8889. I advise to disable update check too. I had to change my "/etc/default/ebusd" after installing the .deb package for raspberry pi:
```
# /etc/default/ebusd:
# config file for ebusd service.

# Options to pass to ebusd (run "ebusd -?" for more info):
EBUSD_OPTS="--scanconfig --httpport 8889 --updatecheck=off"
```

Then restart the daemon:
```
sudo service ebusd restart
```

Then you can open and see available registers from your favorite internet browser, for instance at this address: [http://192.168.0.10:8889/data?def](http://192.168.0.10:8889/data?def) (change IP address to ebusd hosting device IP address or name, change 8889 port to whatever port you configured for HTTP JSON):

    ]
...
```

## Installing

Copy the plugin.py to domoticz directory/plugins/DomoticzEbusd or change directory to domoticz directory/plugins and issue the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/guillaumezin/DomoticzEbusd
```

To update, overwrite plugin.py or change directory to domoticz directory/plugins/DomoticzEbusd and issue the following command:
```
git pull
```

Restart Domoticz.

If you don't see the plugin in the hardware configuration tab, give for everyone read permission to plugin and read and execute permission for directory, for Linux:
```
cd whatever/plugins
chmod ugo+rx DomoticzEbusd
chmod ugo+r DomoticzEbusd/plugin.py
```

Restart Domoticz.

## Configuration
Add the ebusd-bridge hardware in Domoticz hardware configuration tab, giving the ebusd hosting device IP address or name, the telnet port, the HTTP JSON port, the registers, and set the refresh rate, read-only mode and debug mode. The refresh rate reads the registers values at the given rate in seconds.

The registers parameter can be left empty. In that case, the plugin will create devices for every register if read-only parameter is set to one of the "add discovered devices" choices and they will be added to Setup / Devices as unused, you will have to set the devices you're interested into as used. You can have a look to Setup / Log / Status tab the see created registers. However it is recommended to limit to useful registers. It is advised to create a first hardware with empty registers parameter, then to restart Domoticz, to look at devices created and to keep only useful registers by creating a new ebusd-bridge hardware with registers filled-in then to delete the first ebusd-bridge hardware. You can also change the read-only parameter to one of the "don't add discovered devices" then delete useless devices.

You can add many registers separated by space. Registers preceded with character `!` will be excluded. The register names have following convention:
```
broadcast:outsidetemp: bai:SetMode:hcmode bai:SetMode:2 bai:SetMode:hwcflowtempdesired f47:RoomTemp:0 f47:Hc1OPMode: mc:InternalOperatingMode470: mc:Flow1Sensor: mc:FlowTempDesired: bai:FlowTemp: bai:ReturnTemp: bai:FlowTempDesired: bai:StorageTemp: f47:Hc1SFMode: f47:Hc2SFMode: bai:WaterPressure: f47:Hc1HolidayStartPeriod: f47:Hc1HolidayEndPeriod: f47:Hc2HolidayStartPeriod: f47:Hc2HolidayEndPeriod: !:sensor$
```

This is case insensitive. If you specify filters, corresponding devices will be set as used directly. The first part of a register is the circuit name, the second part must be a message name (third level of JSON data), and the third part is the index, or the name (possible only if different than "") of field in fielddefs of a message in JSON data.

For instance `bai:SetMode:2` in my case gives `hwctempdesired` fielddefs value, i.e. the desired hot water temperature, because it is the second field of bai->messages->SetMode register. It could have been configured with `bai:SetMode:hwctempdesired` directly. Fielddefs type "IGN" are ignored for index counting and name searching. For instance `bai:SetMode:4` give the same result as `bai:SetMode:disablehc`. 

The search is based on [Python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), meaning for instance that:
* `flow` will match all registers containing `flow` in any position of the complete register name (all fields of `mc:Flow1Sensor:`, `mc:FlowTempDesired:`, `bai:FlowTemp:`, `bai:FlowTempDesired` plus `bai:SetMode:hwcflowtempdesired`
* `broadcast:outsidetemp:` will match all fields of message `outsidetemp` of circuit `broadcast`
* `^f47:hc` will match all fields of all message names beginning with `hc` of circuit `f47` (all fields of `f47:Hc1OPMode:`, `f47:Hc1SFMode:` and `f47:Hc2SFMode:`)
* `^f47:.*temp.*` will match all fields of all message names containing temp for circuit `f47` (`f47:RoomTemp:`)
* `:.*period:` will match every messages ending with `period` (all fields of `f47:Hc1HolidayStartPeriod:`, `f47:Hc1HolidayEndPeriod:`, `f47:Hc2HolidayStartPeriod:`, `f47:Hc2HolidayEndPeriod:`)
* `:hwcflowtempdesired$` will match all registers with a field named `hwcflowtempdesired` (`bai:SetMode:hwcflowtempdesired`)
* `!:sensor$` will exclude all registers with a field named `sensor`

You can add more than one ebusd-bridge hardware to Domoticz, for instance to get some registers as read-only and others as writable.

In case of troubles, check that "Accept new Hardware Devices" is enabled, at least temporaly (in Setup / Settings / System / Hardware/Devices).

## Particular case of holiday mode

Holiday mode can be activated only by setting a start and end date. If you set "holiday" to Hc1SFMode or Hc2SFMode, it won't be effective. Domoticz doesn't handle date devices, so f47:Hc1HolidayStartPeriod f47:Hc1HolidayEndPeriod f47:Hc2HolidayStartPeriod f47:Hc2HolidayEndPeriod will appear as read-only text devices. To set holiday mode from Domoticz, you can create a virtual switch and create a Lua or dzVents script, here is an example where "Holiday mode" is a virtual switch:
```
return {
	on = {
		devices = {
			'Holiday mode'
		}
	},
	execute = function(domoticz, device)
		domoticz.log('Device ' .. device.name .. ' was changed', domoticz.LOG_ERROR)
	        if (device.active) then
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc1holidaystartperiod - date").update(0, "01.01.2010").afterSec(1)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc2holidaystartperiod - date").update(0, "01.01.2010").afterSec(2)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc1holidayendperiod - date").update(0, "01.01.2090").afterSec(3)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc2holidayendperiod - date").update(0, "01.01.2090").afterSec(4)
	        else
	            local yesterdayDate = domoticz.time.timestampToDate(domoticz.dDate, "dd.mm.yyyy").addDays(-1)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc1holidaystartperiod - date").update(0, yesterdayDate).afterSec(1)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc2holidaystartperiod - date").update(0, yesterdayDate).afterSec(2)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc1holidayendperiod - date").update(0, yesterdayDate).afterSec(3)
	            domoticz.devices("ebusd bridge - f47:hc2holidayendperiod - date").update(0, yesterdayDate).afterSec(4)
	       end
	end
}
```

Now you can set "On" and "Off", even using Timers, on "Holiday mode" virtual switch, to disable heating circuits. Hot water production will be disabled automatically when all heating circuits are in holiday mode with my calorMATIC VRC470f control. This will work with Domoticz from version 3.9415 onwards, because on earlier version, update() methods from Lua and dzVents event scripts are not passed to python plugins.

## Script examples

dzVents script to automatically switch from summer mode to auto mode
```
-- temperature to decide summer mode
highTempLevel = 20
-- temperature to decide winter mode
lowTempLevel = highTempLevel - 4
-- consecutive days to watch
nDaysToWatch = 3
-- temperature device
temperatureDevice = "Temp챕rature ext챕rieure"
-- heating device 1
heating1Device = "Mode chauffage RDC"
-- heating device 2
heating2Device = "Mode chauffage 챕tage"
-- selector switch level for summer mode
summerModeLevel = 40
-- selector switch level for winter mode
winterModeLevel = 10

return {
	on = {
		timer = {
		    "at 20:00"
		},
	},
	data = {
	    history = { initial = 0 },
	    mode  = { initial = -1 }
	},
	execute = function(domoticz, item)
    	temperature = domoticz.devices(temperatureDevice).temperature
    	if (domoticz.data.mode == winterModeLevel) then
    	    if (temperature >= highTempLevel) then
    	        if domoticz.data.history < nDaysToWatch then
    	            domoticz.data.history = domoticz.data.history + 1
    	            if domoticz.data.history == nDaysToWatch then
                	    domoticz.log("Switching heating to summer mode")
                	    domoticz.data.mode = summerModeLevel
            	        domoticz.data.history = 0
                		domoticz.devices(heating1Device).switchSelector(domoticz.data.mode)
                		domoticz.devices(heating2Device).switchSelector(domoticz.data.mode)
    	            end
                end
    	    else
    	        domoticz.data.history = 0
            end
        else
    	    if (temperature <= lowTempLevel) then
    	        if domoticz.data.history < nDaysToWatch then
    	            domoticz.data.history = domoticz.data.history + 1
    	            if domoticz.data.history == nDaysToWatch then
                	    domoticz.log("Switching heating to winter mode")
                	    domoticz.data.mode = winterModeLevel
            	        domoticz.data.history = 0
                		domoticz.devices(heating1Device).switchSelector(domoticz.data.mode)
                		domoticz.devices(heating2Device).switchSelector(domoticz.data.mode)
    	            end
                end
	        else
   	            domoticz.data.history = 0
            end
	    end
    end
}
```

## Install Domoticz and Ebusd with docker compose

[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a convenient way to install and execute Domoticz and Ebusd together.

The following `docker-compose.yml` file gives an example to install Ebusd with the "docker compose build" command:
```
version: "3"
services:
    ebusd:
        container_name: ebusd
        volumes:
            - ./config:/opt/config
            - /dev:/host_dev
        ports:
            - "127.0.0.1:8888:8888"
            - "8889:8889"
        environment:
            - EBUSD_SCANCONFIG
            - EBUSD_DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0
            - EBUSD_CONFIGLANG=en
            - EBUSD_LOG=all error
            - EBUSD_HTTPORT=8889            
            - EBUSD_UPDATECHECK=off
        image: john30/ebusd
        networks:
            - ebusd

networks:
  ebusd:
    name: ebusd
    driver: bridge
    attachable: true
```
Please note that with this configuration, to access to telnet prompt, this will only possible from the machine executing docker. The address in plugin parameters will have to be the external IP address of the machine executing docker, for instance 192.168.1.100, the address 127.0.0.1 will not work.

The following `docker-compose.yml` file example indicates how to put ebusd and domoticz in a private network:
```
version: '3'
  ebusd:
    container_name: ebusd
    volumes:
        - ../ebusd-docker-compose/config:/opt/config
    ports:
        - "127.0.0.1:8888:8888"
    expose:
        - "8889"
    environment:
        - EBUSD_SCANCONFIG
        - EBUSD_DEVICE=/dev/ttyUSB0
        - EBUSD_CONFIGLANG=en
        - EBUSD_LOG=all error
        - EBUSD_HTTPPORT=8889
        - EBUSD_UPDATECHECK=off
    image: john30/ebusd
    networks:
        - domoticz

  domoticz:
    image: domoticz/domoticz:2024.1
    container_name: domoticz
    depends_on:
      - ebusd
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/opt/domoticz/userdata
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
      #- LOG_PATH=/opt/domoticz/userdata/domoticz.log
    networks:
      - domoticz

networks:
  domoticz:
    name: domoticz
    driver: bridge
```

`../ebusd-docker-compose/config` must be created, to contain ebusd config. `./config` must be created to contain Domoticz config. `./config/plugins` is the directory to put Domoticz plugins. Please note that with this configuration, to access to telnet prompt, this will only possible from the machine executing docker and only Domoticz will be able to access 8889 port. The address in plugin parameters will have to be "ebusd".
